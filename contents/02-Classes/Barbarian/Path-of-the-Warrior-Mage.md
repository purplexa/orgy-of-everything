# Barbarian

Last updated 12/25/2020

## Primal Path
At 3rd level, a barbarian gains the Primal Path feature. The Path of the Warrior Mage option is available to a barbarian, in addition to those offered in the *Player’s Handbook*

### Path of the Warrior Mage

For most barbarians, their innate abilities and spellcasting do not mix. However, a rare few demonstrate limited natural spellcasting abilities. For these select individuals, dedicated training leads them down the Path of the Warrior Mage.

##### Path of the Warrior Mage Features

| Barbarian Level | Feature |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 3rd  | Spellcasting, Natural Inclination |
| 6th  | Arcane Revitalization |
| 10th | Mystic Protection |
| 14th | Buffed Rage |

#### Spellcasting

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast select spells. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting.

As a spellblade, while raging, you can continue to concentrate on a barbarian spell you already cast, but you cannot cast new spells.

***Spell Slots.*** The Path of the Warrior Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *command* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level slot available, you can cast *command* using either slot.

***Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.*** You know three 1st-level barbarian spells of your choice.

The spells Known column of the Path of the Warrior Mage Spellcasting table shows when you learn more barbarian spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the barbarian spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your barbarian spells, since your spells come from your innate force of will. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a barbarian spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use any weapon with the two-handed or versatile property as a spellcasting focus for your barbarian spells.


#### Natural Inclination

At 3rd level, you learn your choice of one of the following cantrips: *control flames*, *gust*, *mold earth*, *shape water*.

You learn an additional one of these cantrips when you reach 6th level, 10th level, and 14th level in this class.

#### Arcane Revitalization

Starting at 6th level, while you are raging, you can use a bonus action to expend a spell slot and gain 1d10 temporary hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

#### Mystic Protection

Starting at 10th level, you gain a measure of resilience against magical attacks. As a reaction when you are forced to make a saving throw against a spell, you can grant yourself advantage on the roll. You must complete a short or long in order to use this feature again.

\page

#### Buffed Rage
Starting at 14th level, when you rage, as a reaction, you can cast a barbarian spell which has a casting time of 1 action, a range of Self, and a duration of at least 1 minute. You must expend a spell slot as normal.
