# Sorcerer
## Sorcerous Origin
At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature. The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the *Player’s Handbook*

### Unicorn Spirit
While their beauty and association with rainbows can be disarming, unicorns are fierce warriors. Somewhere along the line, you or an ancestor of yours received a dose of this spirit: perhaps you were blessed by a unicorn as an infant, or maybe one of your ancestors saved the life of a unicorn and received a gift of power. However you obtained it, this connection to the spirit of the unicorn grants you great power.

##### Unicorn Spirit Features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Rainbow Magic, Unicorn’s Horn |
| 6th  | Extra Attack |
| 14th | Rainbow Strider |
| 18th | Unicorn’s Presence |

```
```

#### Rainbow Magic

You know the *distracting beams* cantrip, and you learn additional spells when you reach
certain levels in this class, as shown on the
Unicorn Spells table. Each spell counts as a
sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count
against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a
level in this class.

##### Unicorn Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | *chromatic orb*, *shield of faith* |
| 3rd  | *branding smite*, *mirror image* |
| 5th | *blinding smite*, *daylight* |
| 7th | *aura of purity*, *greater invisibility* |
| 9th | *creation*, *destructive wave* |

#### Unicorn’s Horn
At 1st level, you gain the ability to coalesce your power into mystical weapons. As a bonus action, you can form an opalescent sword or shield, or one of each, in a free hand. These white items, sparkling in a rainbow of colors, last one minute or until you dismiss them (no action needed). A sword created this way counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient that deals 1d8 slashing damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). The shield counts as a normal shield with which you are proficient. You cannot create more than one sword or one shield in this way at a time. As a bonus action, you can cause one or both of these conjured items to disappear from wherever they are and reappear in your hand.

While holding one or both of these items, you can use a bonus action to grant yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to your level in this class. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you reach 6th level in this class, a sword conjured in this way counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance.

When you reach 14th level in this class, you gain +1 to your attack and damage rolls with a sword conjured in this way. At 18th level, this bonus increases to +2.

#### Extra Attack
At 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

#### Ascendant Mount
At 14th level, you can spend 10 minutes and 4 sorcery points to summon a spirit in the form of a loyal pegasus. Appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, the creature has the statistics provided for it in the *Monster Manual*.

You control this mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.

The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action, leaving behind any objects it was wearing or carrying. You can resummon the mount with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed by spending another 10 minutes and 4 sorcery points.

#### Unicorn’s Presence
At 18th level, you can embody the beautiful and terrible presence of the unicorn. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to subtly change your appearance to be both more lovely and more intimidating. For 1 minute or until you dismiss the feature as a bonus action, you can force any creature attempting to target you with an attack or a spell to make a Charisma saving throw against you spell save DC. On a failure, they must choose another target or forfeit the action. As well, a creature who fails the saving throw by 5 or more is charmed by you or frightened of you (your choice) for the duration of the feature.
