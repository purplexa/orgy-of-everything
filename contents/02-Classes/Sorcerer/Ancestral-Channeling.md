# Sorcerer

## Sorcerous Origin
At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature. The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the *Player’s Handbook*

### Ancestral Channeling

You have an unusually strong connection with your ancestors. Perhaps this sense of their spirits is a recent change, or perhaps you have had this ability since birth. Regardless, your connection to the spirits of your ancestors grants you access to great and powerful magic.

##### Ancestral Channeling Features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Unicorn’s Horn |
| 6th  | Extra Attack |
| 14th | Rainbow Strider |
| 18th | Unicorn’s Presence |

#### Ancestral Magic

You learn additional spells when you reach
certain levels in this class, as shown on the
Ancestral Spells table. Each spell counts as a
sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count
against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a
level in this class.

##### Ancestral Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | *protection from evil and good*, *shield* |
| 3rd  | *augury*, *detect thoughts* |
| 5th | *protection from energy*, *speak with dead* |
| 7th | *confusion*, *death ward* |
| 9th | *animate objects*, *scrying* |

#### Ancestral Boons

You gain the following features:

***Ancestral Guardians.***
Your connection to your ancestors allows you to call on them to protect you in your time of need. When you aren't wearing armor, you can count your AC as 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

***Ancestral Knowledge.***
You are highly skilled, being able to draw on your ancestors' knowledge to accomplish tasks. You gain proficiency with one skill and one set of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### Ancestral Sight

At 6th level, you gain the ability to see through the eyes of your ancestors' spirits. You can cast the *clairvoyance* spell without expending a spell slot or providing material components. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest.

```
```

#### Ancestral Confidence

At 14th level, you can draw upon your ancestors to make yourself more confident. As a bonus action, for 1 minute you can increase your Charisma score by 2, even above your normal maximum. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or spend 4 sorcery points.

#### Ancestral Vessel

At 18th level, you draw on the collective power of all your ancestors, leaving you in a powerful, yet vulnerable, state. As an action, you can open yourself to this power, gaining the following traits for one min:

- Your eyes glow.
- Your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
- You can reroll ones and twos on damage dice for you spells.
- You have proficiency in all saving throws.
- You behave as if under the effects of the *levitate* spell.
- If you drop to 0 HP and subsequently die, you cannot be resurrected by any means short of a *wish* spell or divine intervention.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
