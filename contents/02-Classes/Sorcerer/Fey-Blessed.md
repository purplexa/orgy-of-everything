# Sorcerer

## Sorcerous Origin
At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature. The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the *Player’s Handbook*

### Fey-Blessed

You or an ancestor were blessed by a member of the Fey.

##### Fey-Blessed Features
| Sorcerer Level | Feature |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | Fey Magic, Fey Tongue |
| 6th  | Extra Attack |
| 14th | Rainbow Strider |
| 18th | Unicorn’s Presence |

#### Fey Magic

Your link to the Fey allows you to learn spells from the druid class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

In addition, you know the *fey blade* and *fey bow* cantrips, which count as sorcerer spells for you, and you learn additional spells when you reach
certain levels in this class, as shown on the
Fey-Blessed Spells table. Each spell counts as a
sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count
against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a
level in this class.

***Bonus Language.*** You can speak, read, and write Sylvan.

***Bonus Proficiency.*** You are proficient in the Insight skill.

#### Something about Glamour or charging

At 6th level, 

#### Sylvan Flight

At 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of wings from your back. These wings take the appearance of dragonfly wings or butterfly wings (your choice). While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor or clothing unless it is made to accommodate them.

#### Fey Mastery

At 18th level, choose one of *invisibility* or *misty step*. You learn this spell, if you do not already know it, and you can cast it at-will, without expending a spell slot or providing components.

You can choose a different spell at the end of a long rest.
