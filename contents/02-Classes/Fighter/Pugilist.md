### Pugilist
Sometimes, weapons just don't have the "personal" touch that someone really deserves. That's why the gods gave you fists.

#### Kickpuncher
Starting when you reach 3rd level in this class, your punches have the power of kicks. You can use a d4 as the damage for your unarmed strikes with your fists.

#### One-Two Punch
At 3rd level, when you make an unarmed strike attack with your fist as part of the Attack action, you can make an additional attack with your other fist, provided both hands are free. When you do so, you only add your Strength modifier to the damage of one of the two attacks, as the rapid nature of the punches prevents you from bringing your full strength to bear on both hits.

#### Elemental Punch
At 7th level, you can channel elemental energy into your fists. Your unarmed strikes with your fists become magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistence. Additionally, as a bonus action, you select one of the following damage types: cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Until the beginning of your next turn, the damage type for your unarmed strikes using your fists becomes the chosen type. You can use this ability a number of times equal to you Constitution modifier, and you regain expended uses at the end of a short or long rest.

#### Greater Elemental Punch
At 10th level, you gain a greater ability to channel elemental energy into your fists. When you hit a creature with one of the attacks using your Elemental Punch, they suffer additional effects based on the element chosen. Some of these effects require an affected creature to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

***Cold.*** You freeze parts of the target enough to make their movements stiff. The target's speed is halved until the beginning of your next turn.

***Fire.*** You leave a persisting burn on the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, whenever the target is hit by a weapon attack, they must make succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take an additional 1d4 fire damage.

***Lightning.*** The shock of your attack makes it difficult for the target to hold onto its gear. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or drop whatever it is holding.

***Thunder.*** The reverberation of sound through the target damages its hearing. The target must suceed on a Constitution saving throw or be deafened for one minute.
