### Way of the Empath
Whether by a natural affinity or intensive dedication, monks of the Way of the Empath interact with the ki of others by sensing their spiritual auras. Through study of this ability they learn to connect to others in a deeper way, and the most adept can even influence the emotions of others. While most such practitioners use this ability to help others, soothing their pain and struggles, some take advantage of the vulnerability of others, manipulating their emotions to exploit them.

#### Path of the Empath
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn to use your ability to read auras to empower yourself both in and out of battle. You gain the following benefits.

***Mental Warrior.***
Whenever you deal damage to a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can choose to change the damage type of that attack to psychic.

***Empowered Understanding.***
You can spend 2 ki points to cast *detect thoughts*, without expending a spell slot or providing material components.

***Bonus Proficiency.***
You gain proficiency in your choice of one of the following skills: Insight, Perception, Intimidation, Persuasion.

#### Heart’s Aura
At 3rd level, your understanding of ki allows you to sense the auras of others and glean information from them. As a bonus action, you can touch a creature, instantly knowing its current emotional state.

The range for this ability increases when you gain levels in this class: to 15 feet at level 6, to 30 feet at level 11, and to 60 feet at level 17.


#### Battle Prescience
At 6th level, your ability to read auras enables you to predict the actions of your opponents. As a bonus action, you can spend 2 ki points to give yourself advantage on all attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn. You also receive a +1 bonus to your AC during this time, as you read your opponents’ auras to sense their intentions.


#### Aura Attunement

At 11th level, your attunement to auras grants you the following benefits.

***Sense Auras***
Your ability to sense the presence of auras grows to allow you to sense the presence of distant auras. As an action you can spend 4 ki points to choose one of the creature types: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, humanoids, monstrosities, oozes, plants, undead.

You detect the auras for any creature of the chosen type within 500 feet of you, learning their locations relative to you, as well as a rough idea of the strength of their aura.

| Aura Strength | CR Range |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Weak  | up to 1 |
| Moderate  | 2-10 |
| Great | 11-20 |
| Powerful | over 20 |

***Shape Auras***
Your control over your own aura allows you to extend that aura to envelop others, shaping their emotions. Immediately after reading a creature’s emotional state with your Heart’s Aura feature, as an action, you can spend 3 ki points to attempt to shift that creatures emotional state. Choose to either *excite* or *calm* the target’s emotions. The target must then make a Wisdom saving throw. On success, your attempt to shape the target’s emotions fails. If the target exceeded the DC by 5 or more, the target becomes aware of your attempt to manipulate their emotions; otherwise, the target does not realize you attempted to manipulate their emotions. On a failure, the targets emotions shift depending on how you chose to affect them. If you chose to *excite* emotions, the target’s emotions are heightened, based on the discretion of the DM. Similarly, if you chose to *calm* emotions, the target’s emotional responses are dampened in a way the DM deems appropriate.

#### Mass Shape Auras

At 17th level, your ability to influence the emotions of others grows until you can shape the will of crowds. As an action, you can spend 5 ki points to shape the emotions of a crowd. Choose to either *excite* or *calm* those around you. Each creature within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw (the DM may wish to perform a single group roll for a large group). On failure, the target has their emotions shaped in a new direction. If you chose to *excite* emotions, the target becomes prone to increased emotional responses. If you chose to *calm* emotions, the target becomes more relaxed, slower to change their emotional response. Regardless, your subtle touch goes undetected.

The effect lasts as long you maintain concentration, as if you were concentrating on a spell, up to 10 minutes. While the effect is active, as an action, you can switch between *exciting* and *calming* emotions. When you do so, each affected creature makes the saving throw again, and, on a success, the effect ends on them.
