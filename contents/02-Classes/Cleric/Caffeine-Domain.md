### Caffeine Domain
Flavour text goes here.

#### Domain Spells
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Caffeine Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Caffeine Domain Spells
| Cleric Level | Spells |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1st  | *expeditious retreat, false life* |
| 3rd  | *blur, enhance ability* |
| 5th  | *catnap, haste* |
| 7th  | *freedom of movement, sickening radiance* |
| 9th  | *animate objects, steel wind strike* |

#### Accelerated Action
Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you learn to draw on your caffeine infused essence to act quickly. 

Once per turn, you can choose to take an additional action. This action can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Help, or Use an Object action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest

#### Channel Divinity: Morning Joe
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to keep your allies awake.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and choose up to 6 creatures within 30 feet of you. The chosen creatures gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your cleric level plus your Wisdom modifier.

While the chosen creatures still have temporary hit points from this feature, they cannot be forced to sleep by any means.

RULES REMINDER: Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest. (PHB 198)

#### Stimulant Injection
At 6th level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature other than yourself and give it a burst of vigilance. The creature can add 1d8 to its initiative rolls for 1 hour, or until you use this feature again.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Five Day Energy (5 Hour Energy?)
At 17th level, your blood courses with the energy of your divine connection. Until you reach 6 levels of exhaustion, you suffer none of the effects of the exhausted condition. 

Additionally, *time stop* is added to the list of domain spells for you.
