# Class: Witch


#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose witch as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a witch.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If witch isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a witch: light armor, simple weapons, one skill from this class's skill list, herbalism kit

## Class Features
As a witch, you gain the following class features
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per notary level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per notary level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

### Witch Points

### Coven Magic

#### Cantrips (0-Level Spells)

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional witch cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells; your understanding of herbs, medicine, nature, and the interconnectedness of life allows you to cast these spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a witch spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.


**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a witch spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. You must use a cauldron or similar pot made of iron or some other metal alongside your herbalism kit to cast a spell in this way.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an herbalism kit as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.
