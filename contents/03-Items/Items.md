### Bloody Hand Wraps
*wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

These hand wraps slowly but constantly ooze blood from them, as if you were bleeding. While wearing them, you get a +2 bonus to your attack and damage rolls on your unarmed strikes, and the damage type of your unarmed strikes becomes necrotic.

In addition, you can cast the *shadow of moil* spell through the wraps once per day, without expending a spell slot or providing material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

**Cursed.** Once you don these cursed hand wraps, you can't doff them unless you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing these hand wraps, you have vulnerability to radiant damage, and after each long rest, you must sacrifice two hit dice from your pool, rolling them and taking damage equal to their sum. If you have hit dice available of multiple sizes, you must choose the highest available hit dice.


### Cloth Facemask of Social Distancing
*wondrous item, common* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

While wearing this cloth facemask over your mouth, other creatures are discouraged from coming near you. When a creature attempts to move closer to you than 6 feet, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they can move closer. On a success, they are prevented from moving closer than 6 feet to you until the start of their next turn. A creature cannot willingly fail this saving throw.


### Harp of the Aether
*wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This jewelry consists of a plain gold bracelet attached by harp strings to five gold rings, each with a small gemstone of a different color. When worn by an attuned bard proficient in the harp, this jewelry acts as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. While wearing it, you can feel the threads of reality beneath your fingertips. Reaching out with your fingers, you can pluck the strands of reality as if it were a harp. When you do, a light briefly glows like a plucked harpstring in the color of the gem on the finger you used, and the desired note rings out clear and true.


### Kazooie's Backpack
*wondrous item, legendary* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This blue backpack has an interior space that grows to fit its contents, able to hold any object or creature up to 1000 lb, but only able to hold five distinct objects or creatures. The backpack weighs no more than 15 pounds and has exterior dimensions of 24"x18"x12", regardless of its contents. 

The backpack is immune to all damage, and any creature or object fully inside the backpack is immune to damage from outside the backpack. Creatures can survive indefinitely inside the backpack, so long as they have a supply of food and water, as the backpack converts CO2 to oxygen. Creatures can open the backpack from inside the backpack. Clothing, armor, and weapons worn on a creature do not count as distinct objects, but a creature cannot don or doff clothing or armor and cannot draw or wield weapons while fully inside the backpack. 

Placing *Kazooie's backpack* into a *portable hole*, *bag of holding*, *Heward's handy haversack*, or similar item acts as if the backpack were a nonmagical backpack. Placing a *portable hole*, *bag of holding*, *Heward's handy haversack*, or similar item into *Kazooie's backpack* has no special effect.


### Lucifer's coin
*wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This coin made of an unknown bronze-colored metal was forged by a fallen angel in a far-off hell-like plane that no longer exists. A creature attuned to this coin will always bring the coin with it if its soul or body ends up in the Nine Hells.

As an action while a creature is in the Nine Hells, it can hold the coin and speak a command word in Infernal. If the creature arrived in the Nine Hells by dying, the its soul returns to its body and its life is restored, as if it were the target of a true resurrection spell. If the creature entered the Nine Hells by any means other than dying, it is transported back to the Material Plane, reappearing in the last spot it occupied on the plane, or the nearest unoccupied spot if that spot is occupied. Regardless, the coin disappears and any contracts between the creature and a devil or other denizen of the Nine Hells are declared null and void.


### The Pun-isher
*boomerang, uncommon* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This boomerang can be wielded as a melee weapon or as a thrown weapon.

When thrown, it returns to the wielder's hand. On a hit, it deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Regardless of whether the attack hits, the boomerang cracks a terrible joke in the last language its wielder spoke. Any creature, friendly or not, within 20 feet of the target of the attack that can hear and understand any language must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A creature which does not understand the language the joke was in automatically succeeds on the saving throw. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes 1d6 psychic damage as they find the joke to be so bad it's painful. A creature that fails the saving throw has their speed halved for their next turn, due to being overcome by fits of laughter.

### Rod of Eager Teleportation
*wondrous item, legendary* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This sentient rod made of a transparent crystal seems to be constantly flickering between images of far-off places while constantly wiggling in a seemingly impossible manner. The rod can hold 4 charges and regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can ask the rod to expend a charge and cast teleport targeting any creature within range of the rod. If there are more than 8 willing creatures within 10 feet of the rod, the rod chooses the nearest 8 creatures to bring with it. When you describe the desired location to the rod, roll a d6. On a 1 or 2, the rod gets overeager and casts the spell before you finish describing the location. Since the rod cannot hold objects, it cannot use an associated object to target the spell.


### Staff of the Empath
*weapon (quarterstaff), rare (requires attunement by a Way of the Empath Monk)* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This quarterstaff at first glance appears to be a simple 18 inch long club carved out of high quality, sturdy wood.

While holding the staff, you can mentally command it to extend into a 6 foot long quarterstaff (no action required). As an action when it is extended, you can collapse it back down to its original size. When extended to a full quarterstaff in this way, its damage type becomes psychic.

The staff can hold a maximum of 6 charges and contains 1d6 charges when first found. It regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
As a bonus action, you can speak a command word and expend a charge. For the next minute, all melee attacks you make with the staff deal an additional amount of psychic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.


### Super Hammer
*maul, rare* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This comically large hammer features a plain wooden haft and an oversize double mallet head of black iron. As an action, you can activate SUPER MODE, causing it to swing on its own for 1 minute. Its damage dice increase to 3d6 for the duration, and when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action, but the only action you can take on your turn is Attack, even if another effect would normally force you to take a different action. You become incapacitated for two turns when the SUPER MODE ends, as the effort of holding onto the rapidly swinging hammer has left you tired and sore.


### Beam of Feline Targeting
*wondrous item, uncommon* <div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

This tiny, handheld cylinder has a single button on the side. When pressed, a tiny, focused beam of red light extends indefinitely, causing a small red dot to appear on whatever surface it points at. As an action while the beam is pointed at a creature which uses eyes to see, you can attempt to shine the beam into the creature's eyes. The target makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Creatures with darkvision who are in dim light or darkness have disadvantage on this check. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll before the beginning of your next turn. 

Additionally, you can cast conjure animals while pointing the device at a creaturea. When you do so, you always summon 8 cats who ignore your verbal commands and single-mindedly attack the creature targeted by the beam at the time of casting. You can change the target by using a bonus action to point the beam at a new creature. When cast this way, you do not have to maintain concentration on the spell. The device regains the ability to allow you to cast conjure animals in this way each day at dawn.
