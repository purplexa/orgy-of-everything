## Dragonette

*Dragonettes are small, wyvern-like creatures distantly related to pseudodragons. Their compelling need for companionship often results in their bonding to a creature at first sight.*

### Dragonette Names

Dragonette names are often long and flowing descriptions in Draconic of a natural phenomenon, which other creatures find difficult and unwieldly to use. Often, their bonded companion will pick a nickname for them which they will use as their name with humanoids, so long as they remain bonded to that companion.

### Dragonette Traits

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Dragonettes mature quickly after hatching. They are considered youths ready to go out into the world at 4 years old, but they typically do not return home until they reach breeding age after a few hundred years, at which point they retire from adventuring to share their experiences with others, breed, and teach hatchlings.

***Alignment.*** Dragonettes can be found with any alignment. Young dragonettes are impressionable and tend to adopt a similar alignment to their companions. As they age, they tend to adopt perspectives based on their formative years. Some such older youths will seek out companions of similar alignments, while others will seek out ones with opposing viewpoints.

***Size.*** Depending on age, Dragonettes can range from 3 feet long to over 6 feet long, standing to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with a wingspan stretching 5 to 10 feet. Lean muscle means they usually weigh between 25 and 50 pounds. Your size is Small.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 15 feet.

***Dragon.*** Your creature type is dragon, rather than humanoid.

***Slender Form.*** You can move through or occupy the space of any friendly creature that is of a size larger than yours.

***Scurry.*** You can take the Dash action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

***Winged.*** You possess no arms, but you do possess a pair of wings with prehensile claws at the ends that you can use to manipulate objects. As long as you are not restrained, when you fall, your rate of descent is 60 feet per round, and you take no falling damage. If you choose to, you can glide, in which case you can choose to slow your rate of descent further, to 30 feet per round. If you do so, you must move 15 feet laterally per round. This movement does not count against your base walking speed. While gliding, you can also choose to slow your rate of descent even further, to 15 feet per round, in which case, you must move 30 feet laterally per round, which does not count against your base walking speed. If subjected to an effect that would reduce your fly speed to 0, you cannot glide.

***Companion Bond.*** You can form a bond with another sentient creature. If you have no bond, as an action, you can choose to bond to another creature you can see. This creature must have an Intelligence score of at least 4 and you must share at least one language in order for you to bond with them in this way. Once bonded, each of you immediately knows whenever the other takes damage, so long as you are on the same plane of existence. As well, as an action when you are within 100 feet of your companion, you can project your mind toward them. When you do so, you can communicate simple emotions to them, such as anger, joy, fear, or exhaustion. While bonded to a creature in this way, at the end of a long rest, either of you can choose to severe the bond. If you do so, you each suffer a point of exhaustion that can only be removed by taking a long rest.

***Draconic Magic.*** You know either the *fire bolt* or *ray of frost* cantrip (your choice). Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *absorb elements* spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the *fly* spell, targeting yourself, without providing material components or needing to maintain concentration, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you do so, you can use your action on each turn to carry your bonded companion. Charisma if your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
